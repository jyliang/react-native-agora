// This entire class is to amend a sideeffect:
/*
 1. A and B is in a chat
 2. A enters background, state is Frozen
 3. B observes the Frozen state and makes the correct change
 4. B navigates to a different screen, the state of A is re-render and returns 'Running' which is WRONG.
 
 Solution: ignore first signal after re-render if the state was registered for that remote id before
